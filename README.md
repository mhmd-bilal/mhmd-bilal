## About Me

Hey there! I'm Mohammed Bilal — a code-slinger, design whisperer, and tech enthusiast hailing from Coimbatore, India. I’m currently pursuing an integrated MSc in Decision and Computing Sciences at Coimbatore Institute of Technology, and if you catch me not studying, I’m probably busy building something brilliant.

I wear a couple of hats (no, seriously): I’m the CEO of bCreative, a digital design studio with over 100 happy clients, and the Chief Technical Officer at Studio Bizkit, where I've led 20+ client projects across industries. From user-friendly designs to complex web apps, I love crafting tech that doesn’t just work—but wows.
